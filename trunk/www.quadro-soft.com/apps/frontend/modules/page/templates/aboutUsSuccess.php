        <p>We are a small but professional team of developers who were working hard apart of each other on outsourcing/offshore market since 2000. During that period of time, a lot of projects were successfully completed by each of us both individually and as a part of the team. At last, a common project has consolidated us in one company. </p>
        <p>Quadro Soft is a IT outsourcing/offshore software Ukrainian company which was founded as separate independent business unit in early 2008.  It was established to serve clients from different countries all over the world including USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Ireland, Russian Federation and others on outsourcing and cutting costs basics.</p> 
        <p>The ultimate advantage of our company, besides development quality and member’s professionalism, is that though we position ourselves as a solid company with it’s own structure and organized workflow,  each of our members has equal opportunities inside our company. For you it means that all financial resources which you spend for the project development will be directed to pay for programmer’s work. In turn, this fact makes them much more highly motivated than in any other companies with the same financial expenditures but which have directors, sales managers, product managers etc. In our company we have all necessary staff, distribution of authority and at the same time we are all technically well versed. </p>
