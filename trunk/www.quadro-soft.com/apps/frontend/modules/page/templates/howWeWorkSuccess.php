        <p>A software development process is rather complex concept which has a lot of shades and which requires rather special knowledge. This procedure consists of several stand alone steps which are almost the same in different software development concepts. We use the following:
        <ol>
            <li>Technical task analysis and necessary technologies research. If task in not ready, we can discuss you’re your project via voice Skype or any other suitable for you means;</li>
            <li>Planning: detailed plan for each sprint, the length of each sprint is discussed separately depending on tasks which are included into it;</li>
            <li>Design and Architecture: determine main application modules and their structure as well as the ways of their common integration, DataBase structure and classes architecture;</li>
            <li>Implementing functionality, testing and debugging: writing code classes, testing functionality with different types of data, eliminating logical errors;</li>
            <li>Deployment: we deploy an implemented application to your server, making necessary tunings to make it work in your server’s environment.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>To provide you with a flexible tool which you can use in control and planning purposes we set up bug a tracking system (like Mantis) on our servers where you can create your own tasks and see the progress of existing ones. </p>
        <p>Depending on the project’s scale and goals which are determined by the client at the very beginning of the project, we prefer to use whether Agile software development  approach or Extreme Programming. In fact, both approaches are oriented on a tight communication with a client, his feedbacks and instructions if any. At the same time we can take necessary decisions ourselves or supply client with the best available options in each stand alone situation. We believe that a tight and close communication with a client, understanding his needs and requirements is a gold key to our mutual prosperity.</p>
